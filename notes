line 30 - check
line 24 - passing pointer args to a thread - be sure what you want. Pass by value is better. Also, an fd is type int.
line 29 - attr is not clear. args is a more common term used.
line 33 - semaphore is not required if different threads will write to their own sockets. When they share the same socket, thrn it's good to have.
line 36 - size?
line 42 - 1 is not the size of an int
line 41 - but choice is init to 3 !
line 40 declares a pointer. line 42 requires a buffer.
line 45 - to have the same meaning, use an enum instead of 1/2/3 and define in a shared header file between server and client
line 30 - msg redefines global msg
line 56 - when this happens, also print the invalid value received as a decimal to help with debugging.
line 60 - not a good idea to have blocking calls like recv inside a semaphore. For such an operation, a semaphore is not required. If the entire loop is in a semaphore, parallelism with threads is defeated.
line 86 - During error in system calls, better to print errno or perror()
line 101 - 50 is 50 pending connections
line 112 - what is  this serverStorage
line 118 - what is arg doing in this line?

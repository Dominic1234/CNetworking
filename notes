line 24 - passing pointer args to a thread - be sure what you want. Pass by value is better. Also, an fd is type int.
line 33 - semaphore is not required if different threads will write to their own sockets. When they share the same socket, thrn it's good to have.

line 45 - to have the same meaning, use an enum instead of 1/2/3 and define in a shared header file between server and client
line 60 - not a good idea to have blocking calls like recv inside a semaphore. For such an operation, a semaphore is not required. If the entire loop is in a semaphore, parallelism with threads is defeated.
line 112 - what is  this serverStorage
line 118 - what is arg doing in this line?
